# VWC Capstone Portfolio Approach

**Ship THREE Production Features - One Per Vertical**

---

## 🎯 The Capstone Philosophy

Every Vets Who Code graduate becomes a **Full Product Engineer** by shipping **three production features** to the actual VWC platform:

1. **Software Engineering Feature** (Week 8)
2. **Data Engineering Feature** (Week 13)
3. **AI Engineering Feature** (Week 16)

**Week 17**: Polish, integrate, and present all three features as a portfolio.

---

## 🏆 What Makes This Unique

### Traditional Bootcamp Approach:
❌ Build demo projects that nobody uses
❌ Single capstone in one domain
❌ Code sits in GitHub gathering dust
❌ "I built a todo app clone"

### VWC Approach:
✅ Ship real features to a production platform
✅ Three features across three domains
✅ Code serves thousands of veterans
✅ "I shipped features that help 5,000+ veterans learn to code"

## 💼 The Graduate's Hiring Pitch

**Before VWC**:
> "I'm looking for my first tech job. I completed a bootcamp and have some demo projects on GitHub."

**After VWC** (with 3-feature portfolio):
> "I'm a Full-Stack AI Engineer with production experience. I've shipped three features to Vets Who Code, a platform serving 5,000+ veterans:
>
> **Software**: Built a code playground with 500+ daily users ([PR link], [live demo])
>
> **Data**: Created an ETL pipeline processing 10k+ records daily for student analytics ([PR link], [dashboard demo])
>
> **AI**: Deployed an AI code review bot that saves instructors 20+ hours/week using Gemini and Azure OpenAI ([PR link], [live demo])
>
> I can own features end-to-end from conception to production. Here's my portfolio showing all three with metrics."

## 📝 FAQ

**Q: What if my feature doesn't get used much?**
A: Impact isn't just usage. Even a niche feature shows you can ship production code. Plus, you control the narrative in interviews.

**Q: Can I work with a partner on features?**
A: Some features can be pair-programmed, but each student must own their own feature for their portfolio.

**Q: What if I want to build something not on the backlog?**
A: Propose it! If it fits the skills for that phase and helps VWC, instructors will likely approve.

**Q: What happens to features after I graduate?**
A: They stay in production! VWC maintains them, and future students may enhance them. Your name stays in git history.

**Q: Can I showcase these features to employers?**
A: Absolutely! That's the point. You can demo them, show the code, explain the impact. VWC encourages it.

**Q: What if my feature breaks in production?**
A: Part of the learning! We'll help you debug and fix it. Real engineers deal with production bugs.
