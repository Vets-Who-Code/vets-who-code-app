# VetsWhoCode Brand Style Guide

## June 1, 2016

### Retool, Retrain, Relaunch

#VetsWhoCode is a streamlined, highly selective software development training program intent on transitioning military veterans into the vacancies of the tech sector.

#VetsWhoCode was founded by vets who themselves faced the realities of transitioning. We don't focus our energy on marketing ploys or on how many people we can funnel through a pipeline. Instead, we choose quality over quantity and tangible results over lofty ideals.

We are solution-based and action-oriented. If our students can't make money with it then we don't bother teaching it.

### Results Driven

We focus on the skills you need for the software industry.

### 100% Online

Our workflow ensures that you can learn from anywhere.

### Learn Pragmatically

Learn to think and solve problems like a programmer.

### Prepared for the Industry

Our focus is getting you employment ready.

## Our Logo

The #VetsWhoCode logo is designed to bring together the hashtag and the American flag. It is the emblem that represents everything that we stand for. Use it with intention and purpose.

### The Flag Emblem

The Flag emblem is our brand's shorthand for everything we stand for: America, technology, and moving forward.

You can use the emblem without the logotype on promotional materials and merchandise. However, the logotype must be present in a non-dominant position.

### Logo Misuses

Do not manipulate, tweak, or otherwise alter the #VetsWhoCode logo in any way. Always use the approved Pantone CMYK or RGB values.

## Colors

The #VetsWhoCode color palette is based on the exact Pantones used for the American Flag. Make sure to use the approved Pantone CMYK or RGB color values.

### Color Usage Guidelines

Primary colors (Navy, Red, Cream, Black, Gold) should dominate all brand materials. Extended scales are for UI states, gradients, and functional indicators. Maintain a 60/30/10 ratio: 60% neutrals (Cream, Grays), 30% primary (Navy), 10% accent (Red, Gold).

**Accessibility:** Ensure text maintains minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Navy on Cream and Ink Black on Cream both pass WCAG AA. Red text should only be used on light backgrounds.

**Dark Mode:** Swap Navy (`#091f40`) for Ink Black (`#1A1823`) as background. Replace Navy interactive elements with Light Blue (`#84C1FF`). Shift Red to Coral (`#F38375`) for reduced eye strain. Gold lightens to `#FFE169` for better pop. Off White (`#F8F9FA`) replaces Cream for primary text — pure white (`#FFFFFF`) is too harsh.

## Typography

#VetsWhoCode uses the typeface Gotham for all of its collateral.

Gotham represents the best of both worlds: modern and traditional values. It is a strong and clean typeface that reflects the modernism of technology but still demonstrates the integrity of tradition.

### Headlines

Use Gotham Bold for headlines.

### Body Copy

Use Gotham Book for body copy.

### Captions

Use Gotham Book Italic for captions.

## Example

Retool. Retrain. Relaunch.

Our vision is to close the digital talent gap and ease career transition for military veterans through software development training.
