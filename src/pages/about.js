                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p className="story">
                  Launched in 2014, Vets Who Code is a non-profit dedicated to filling the nations
                  technical skills gap with America’s best. In order to close the
                  digital talent gap, ease career transition for military veterans, and give
                  military spouses skills to provide stability, we connect and train veterans remotely 
                  in web development as they move to support their families.
                  We believe that those who serve in uniform can be the digital economy’s
                  most productive and innovative. Vets Who Code prepares veterans to enter the civilian
                  work force with tangible skills for new careers.
                </p>
                <p className="story">
                  Vets Who Code is a reintegration solution for veterans who believe in the
                  principle of &quot;To Teach a Man To Fish&quot; to better prepare early-stage
                  transitioning veterans who are returning to the workforce. Many veterans are un- and under-employed. 
                  Some have a deep desire to be independent business owners. Their skill sets are desperately needed to enhance
                  local economies and drive innovation. Vets Who Code serves as a launch pad for
                  our veterans and military spouses.

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p className="story">
                  At Vets Who Code, we take a small cohort of veterans and spouses twice a year and
                  train them in programming with a deep focus on JavaScript, the language of the web, over the course of sixteen weeks. 
                  We do this all remotely using the best tools and resources the tech community has to offer. 
                  In addition to contributing and helping each other become better programmers, we do this at zero cost.
                </p>

                <h2>How We Do This</h2>
                <p className="story">
                  How we accomplish this mission is through a process of <i>Crawl, Walk, Run </i>
                  where we build upon each lesson in deeper dives so that veterans become better programmers through each iteration. 
                  Instructors leading the program are also veterans, programmers, and alumni of the
                  program. There are no excuses, the instructor has been
                  through every success and failure you will experience and has ultimately succeeded
                  on the path of becoming a paid programmer.
                </p>

                <h2>WE NEED YOUR HELP</h2>
                <p className="story-last">
                  As our country is going through this unprecedented time with COVID-19, people are
                  wanting to learn the skills of today and tomorrow to future-proof themselves, in order to provide for their families. 
                  Furthermore, due to the nature of for-profit coding schools, many are now learning how to do the work remotely,
                  of which we have been doing for years. As a result, we are having an unprecedented
                  amount of applicants and are looking to expand our abilities to support more
                  teams. Help us by making a tax-deductible <a href="/donate">donation</a> so that
                  not only can we continue the work we are doing for our troops now, but expand our
                  capabilities to help even more veterans and military spouses on the journey of
                  becoming programmers.
