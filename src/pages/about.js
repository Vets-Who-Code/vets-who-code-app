                <p className="story">
                  Launched in 2014, Vets Who Code is a non-profit dedicated to filling the nations
                  technical skills gap with America’s best. As a means to close the digital talent
                  gap, ease career transition for military veterans and spouses skills to provide
                  stability, we connect and train veterans remotely in various programming practices
                  as they move to support their families. We believe that those who serve in uniform
                  can be the digital economy’s most productive and innovative. Vets Who Code
                  prepares veterans to enter the civilian work force with tangible skills for new
                  careers.

                <p className="story">
                  Vets Who Code is a reintegration solution for veterans who believe in the
                  principle of &quot;To Teach a Man To Fish&quot; to better prepare early-stage
                  transitioning veterans who are returning to the workforce. Many veterans are un-
                  and under-employed. Some have a deep desire to be independent business owners.
                  Their skill sets are desperately needed to enhance local economies and drive
                  innovation. Vets Who Code serves as a launch pad for our veterans and military
                  spouses.

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p className="story">
                  At Vets Who Code, we take a small cohort of veterans and spouses twice a year and
                  train them in programming with a deep focus on JavaScript, the language of the
                  web, over the course of sixteen weeks. We do this all remotely using the best
                  tools and resources the tech community has to offer. In addition to contributing
                  and helping each other become better programmers, we do this at zero cost.
                </p>

                <h2>How We Do This</h2>
                <p className="story-last">
                  How we accomplish this mission is through a process of <i>Crawl, Walk, Run </i>
                  where we build upon each lesson in deeper dives so that veterans become better
                  programmers through each iteration. Instructors leading the program are also
                  veterans, programmers, and alumni of the program. There are no excuses, the
                  instructor has been through every success and failure you will experience and has
                  ultimately succeeded on the path of becoming a paid programmer.
