                  Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
                  behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
                  response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
                </p>

                <p className="story">

                  comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
                  aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any

                  will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
                  necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to
                  maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
