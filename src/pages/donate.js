                  Since 2014 we have been successfully training veterans in web development. From
                  holding speaking engagements with industry leaders, to curriculum and teaching, to
                  setting up tours and meetings with top tech companies, we have been on the front
                  lines getting our troops the training and tools that they need to earn the
                  opportunities that the tech industry offers. TO do that we need support from
                  people like you, who not only support veterans but who understand the value of
                  hard work and pushing yourself to obtain a goal. Please continue your support by
                  giving a small donation so that we can continue to train more veterans.
