                    Thank you for your interest in mentoring with VetsWhoCode. This document is
                    intended to share our philosophy on mentoring. We ask mentors to address the
                    technical, professional and personal needs of students. Here is more detail on
                    each of these areas:

                      We ask mentors to address the technical, professional and personal needs of
                      students. Here is more detail on each of these areas:

                      In addition to the three areas addressed above here are a few other items to
                      consider.

                    <h4 className="small-top-pad">Time Commitment</h4>
                    <p>
                      After being formally assigned a mentee we ask mentors to set up a time for an
                      initial chat with their mentee to discuss their needs and generally get to
                      know one another. After this initial meeting, we ask that our mentors check in
                      with their mentee at least once a week to inquire about their progress and if
                      the students have any issues.
                    </p>
                    VetsWhoCode is a virtual organization and Slack is the primary vehicle for
                    communication and activity. We ask mentors to be available in Slack to students
                    and to use slack as a way to check in with mentees on a weekly basis. Mentors
                    and students may also use email or video chat to communicate with one another.
                    Please work with your mentee to establish the best frequency and method of
                    communication for you both.
