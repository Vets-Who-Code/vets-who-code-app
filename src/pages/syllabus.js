                  Our flagship curriculum is designed for two things: to give our veterans skills
                  needed for today&apos;s tech market, and to be a contributing member of
                  VetsWhoCode.

                    Our curriculum is designed using a blend of Kanban and Scrum. We use the Kanban
                    methodology to treat each subject like a ticket to be completed. We do this in a
                    collaborative manner because programming is a team sport. The primary language
                    we will focus on is JavaScript, due to its popularity in the job market, ease of
                    transition through out the stack, practical real world applications, and the
                    scope of tools and resources we can introduce our veterans to, all while keeping
                    language proficiency at the forefront of the program. This way we can introduce
                    front end, back end, DevOps and Cloud Computing skills to our veterans, while
                    continuing to have our troops grow in JavaScript.
