                      is the best transition assistance program out there. I am so grateful for the

                      excited...then mad again. But in the end, I've developed skills that have
                      helped me become a successful frontend developer in Chicago and have found a
                      group of people in VWC that understand me, and we really work and grow

                      &quot;During my transition, I have signed up for and utilized services from
                      over 14 different Non-Profits, Corporate, and State resources. I attended all
                      three US Army military transition tracks (Business, Education, Career), been a
                      part of a variety of technology training programs and transition programs. Of
                      all of these programs, only three have made a significant contribution to my
                      transition, and of these three organizations, only one has truly changed my
                      life for the better. Vets Who Code delivered more value to me than 12 of the
                      non-profits combined.&quot;
