This next level course trains selected MRTs to assist the Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness Program in the delivery of training at the MRT Course. The Facilitator’s role is to assist the MRT Trainer in managing the breakout classroom environment (timing, capturing learning points from students, etc). The MRT-F generates discussions for students with a ratio of 1:6 to teach, learn and the application of the 12 skills. The MRT-F Course is designed to build the MRT's depth of knowledge and develop a facilitation style that maximizes the MRT learning environment. The MRT-F graduates are not qualified to do anything different at the unit level, however, as a result of having a greater exposure to the MRT curriculum, MRT facilitators could be used to guide resilience programs at higher echelons. Facilitators are not authorized to conduct MRT courses that train certified MRTs or award the 8R ASI. The MRTs can only be certified by HQDA DCS G-3/5/7 DAMO CSFF.",
