Diving Specialist CWOs oversee diving operations in all global water temperatures, from unlimited to zero visibility, from cutters, boats, and shore-side facilities, in enclosed spaces, under overhead obstructions, in pristine and contaminated waters, and in water depths to 190 feet. Diving Specialist CWOs manage diver training, administration, and qualification programs; deployment and mission planning; diving equipment maintenance; and diving medical emergency response. Diving Specialist CWOs serve as Command Diving Officers for Regional Dive Lockers, and perform duty in diving staff positions. Diving Specialist CWOs are usually prior DV ratings in the Coast Guard.",
