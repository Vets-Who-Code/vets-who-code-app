Visualize the logo of a brand you love. Now, think about three words you associate with that brand.

When it comes to your business or career, you want people picturing specific things when they think of you. But in order to do that, you need to be intentional about establishing who you are and what it’s like to work with you. Think of this as your brand tattoo. It’s something timeless that never leaves you.

### 1. Only accept projects that are on-brand.

When a new opportunity presents itself, ask yourself: Is this on-brand for me? **Will this contribute to the impact I intend to make?**

When you’re off-brand, you’ll feel like you’re chasing shiny objects because you’re out of alignment. When you’re on-brand, you’ll feel like you’re in flow because you’re making an authentic contribution toward your intended impact.

### 2. Get inspiration from other leaders and influencers who are not in your industry.

Resist the temptation to focus only on your competitors—you’re likely to fall into the trap of imitating someone else. Instead, seek ideas from outside your industry. Don’t copy, but gain inspiration and strategy that you can uniquely translate into your own work.

For example, I’ve always been fascinated by how comedians brand themselves with a style of joke. I’m not a comedian, but I can apply that strategy to what I do.

### 3. Remember: What got you here won’t get you there.

Your brand should be timeless, but the way you translate it will change over time. Think about the brand you visualized at the beginning of this article. Have their product offerings changed? Has their messaging changed over time? Has their aesthetic changed?

Remain open to being taken in a fresh direction while also staying true to your principles and area of impact.

Now, visualize your own brand tattoo. What do you see?
