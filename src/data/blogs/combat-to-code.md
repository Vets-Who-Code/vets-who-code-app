## Introduction

The journey from a military career to the tech world is a unique and challenging transition, one that I have personally navigated. During my six years with the military Security Forces, I developed a set of disciplines, skills, and values that have proven invaluable in my coding career. This post aims to share these experiences, illustrating how the rigor and structure of military life can be a powerful foundation for success in the tech industry. I'll delve into specific practices and mindsets honed during my service and how they have shaped my approach to coding and technology.

## Communication and Collaboration

Effective communication, a skill honed in the military, is crucial in tech. The practice of 'Verbal Judo'—using words to de-escalate conflicts—has been particularly useful in tech environments where collaborative problem-solving is key.

### Preparation and Documentation

Preparation in the military parallels the need in coding to prepare for standup meetings and document work, ensuring accuracy and clarity for complex projects.

## Gearing Up

Understanding and mastering tools, whether in coding or combat, is crucial for success. This section explores the parallels between military equipment and coding tools.

## Building Interrelated Skills

The value of developing a broad skill set in the military is mirrored in tech. Enhancing abilities in areas like math, writing, and public speaking has enriched my tech career.

## Developing Discipline

Discipline is a cornerstone of military life, and maintaining it in civilian life is crucial. This principle has been pivotal in my work at Vets Who Code, applying military discipline to teach, guide, and mentor other veterans.

## Continuous Learning

Embracing continuous learning and viewing each challenge as an opportunity to grow is vital in keeping up with the fast-paced evolution of technology.

## Networking

Networking is critical in both military and tech careers. Building a diverse network has opened numerous opportunities and provided a broader perspective.

## Staying Prepared

"Stay ready, so you don't have to get ready" is a mantra that guides readiness for new opportunities in the dynamic tech industry.

## Conclusion

The transition from military service to a tech career involves different fields, but the core competencies and principles often overlap. The disciplines practiced in the military are invaluable in coding, paving the way for success in the tech industry for veterans.
