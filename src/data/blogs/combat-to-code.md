## Introduction

Transitioning from a military career to the world of coding might seem unconventional at first. Yet, the disciplines, skills, and values I honed during my six years in the military Security Forces have proven invaluable in my coding career. In this post, I'll share how these practices have contributed to my success in the tech industry.

## Communication and Collaboration

The military taught me the importance of proactive communication, a skill equally vital in tech. Whether it's detailing my steps when seeking coding assistance or practicing 'Verbal Judo' to enhance discussions, these communication skills have been crucial in building trust and fostering productive environments in tech just as they were in the military.

### Preparation and Documentation

In the military, preparing for SitRep during Guardmount was crucial. In coding, this translates to being ready for standup meetings. Documenting my work extensively helps me avoid relying solely on memory, much like how reviewing SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) was integral during my service.

## Gearing Up

Understanding and respecting one's tools is critical in both the military and tech worlds. I approach my tech tools - my Mac, Command Line, and VS Code - with the same respect as I did my M4A1 Rifle, M9 Standard Issue Beretta, and Radio in the military.

## Building Interrelated Skills

Just as in the service, building skills not directly related to my primary role has been beneficial. Enhancing my math, writing, time management, teaching, and public speaking skills has positively impacted my tech career, similar to how they did in the military.

## Developing Discipline

Maintaining discipline post-service is crucial. The concept of 'selfish discipline' I practice ensures I continue to grow and help others, a principle I actively promote through my work at Vets Who Code.

## Continuous Learning

In the military, understanding tactics was crucial; in tech, it's about mastering Programming Design Patterns. Embracing continuous learning and viewing every experience as a learning opportunity has been pivotal.

## Networking

Building a diverse network, both within and outside the tech industry, is as important as it was in the military. Networking with professionals in different tech domains and other industries has been invaluable.

## Staying Prepared

The mantra 'Stay ready, so you don't have to get ready' guides me. Keeping my resume updated, maintaining a personal brag document, and consistently creating content ensures I'm always prepared for the next opportunity.

## Conclusion

The transition from military service to a tech career might involve different fields, but the core competencies and principles often overlap. The disciplines I practiced in the military have been incredibly valuable in coding. With the right training, discipline, and preparation, success in the tech industry is achievable for veterans transitioning into civilian life. The principles that guided me in combat continue to steer my journey in code.
