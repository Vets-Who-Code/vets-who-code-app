### Finding Vets Who Code

When I started my journey into Web Development, it began like many others, with a simple Google search, “How to become a Web Developer.” Google instantly returned my query with millions of results in about half a second. I knew shortly after that I needed guidance to navigate the scores of languages, career paths, and resources. Having a military background led me to seek out others with the same values and work ethic as me, inevitably leading me to Vets Who Code. I submitted my application and completed the pre-work. Shortly after, I was accepted into the program, but not all was sunshine and rainbows from there.

I did the work, but things just weren’t clicking. Any other organization would have dragged me along behind them until I got through and sent me on my way. But the leaders at Vets Who Code sat me down and had a blunt conversation with me, the kind of honest, kick-in-the-butt conversation that only comes from people close to you, like friends you have had for years or family. Basically, I was told the work I was doing wasn’t cutting it and I needed to change something and change it fast.

As soon as that conversation was over, I was back at it, studying, watching videos, listening to those in the industry, and most importantly, doing. Eventually, I graduated from the program and got my first developer job as a Mid-Level Frontend Web Developer.

Without Vets Who Code taking the time to not only teach me how to code, but also teach me how to learn, I could have been stuck in the realm of mediocrity.
