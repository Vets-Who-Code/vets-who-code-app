The Military Influencer Conference (MIC) was a dynamic and exciting event that shattered my expectations of what military-focused gatherings could be. Known as the premier gathering for veteran entrepreneurs, creators, military spouses, and community leaders, MIC fosters collaboration, innovation, and professional development across a broad spectrum of industries. Far from the usual military event dominated by a homogeneous group of veterans fitting a predictable mold, MIC was a refreshing departure that set a new standard for inclusion and forward-thinking in military spaces.

For the first time, I found myself in a room filled with remarkable representation from women veterans, veterans of color, and military spouses. It was the largest group of Black and Brown veterans I had ever seen at a military event, and the presence of military spouses further enriched the diversity and sense of community. This inclusivity brought an unmatched feeling of belonging that’s often missing from such spaces. Adding to this powerful experience, I reconnected with one of my first supervisors from my Air Force days—a poignant full-circle moment that underscored the depth of this event's impact on both personal and professional levels.

The conference was bursting with energy as it tackled real, actionable issues facing military and veteran communities. Many sessions were thought-provoking and provided a platform for addressing critical problems. I was honored to contribute to these discussions by giving my own talk, which focused on how AI and data can create transformative solutions for veterans. I challenged the audience to shift from traditional strategies like “winning hearts and minds” to embracing data-driven approaches. If we aim to solve the most pressing problems in our community, we must harness technology to analyze, predict, and implement effective solutions. AI isn’t just a tool for innovation—it’s a cornerstone for creating measurable, sustainable change.

MIC also illuminated how social media is evolving as a critical tool for veteran outreach. Notably, TikTok was the sole major social platform represented, signaling a shift in how we connect with younger veterans and broader audiences. This highlights the platform’s untapped potential for engaging the modern military community and underscores the need to adapt our outreach strategies to the digital age.

However, the conference revealed opportunities for growth—particularly in the tech and AI tracks outside of my own talk. Many organizations showcased their products and initiatives, but it became evident that there’s a significant lag—often five to seven years—in adopting modern technology and data-driven methodologies. This gap represents not just a challenge, but also an immense opportunity to bridge the divide between the potential of AI and its current implementation in military and veteran spaces.

Addressing this requires a collective effort, and the responsibility doesn’t lie solely on organizations. It’s also on us—the veterans who’ve transitioned into tech. Many of us have thrived in the industry, driving innovation and profits for leading companies. Yet, we’ve often struggled to channel that expertise back into the communities that shaped us. I understand the hesitation—competing demands and a lack of clear pathways can make it difficult to give back. But if we want to see real progress, we need to change this narrative.

The skills we use to generate millions for tech companies have the power to create transformative change for veterans and military spouses. To make this a reality, we must take deliberate action—whether by mentoring, collaborating with military-focused organizations, or advocating for tech initiatives tailored to our community’s needs. By working together, we can ensure that emerging technologies are not just talked about at events like MIC but actively leveraged to solve real problems and drive meaningful impact.

For me, this realization has been a turning point. As the Atlanta Military at Microsoft ERG lead and Executive Director of Vets Who Code, I’m uniquely positioned to connect the dots between cutting-edge technology and the needs of our veteran community. By leveraging these roles, I can help bridge the gap, uplift our collective skillset, and drive meaningful change.

The Military Influencer Conference wasn’t just an event—it was a wake-up call. It showed me what’s possible when inclusion is prioritized, highlighted where we’re falling short in leveraging technology, and reminded me of the importance of giving back to the communities that shaped us. The road ahead requires collaboration, focus, and commitment, but I’m optimistic about what we can achieve together. The work begins now.
