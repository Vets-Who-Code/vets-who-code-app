## A New Chapter in Our Mission

We are excited to announce that **Vets Who Code has officially joined the GitHub Global Campus Program!** This partnership marks a significant milestone in our journey to empower veterans with the coding skills they need to thrive in the tech industry. By joining this initiative, Vets Who Code gains access to a suite of powerful tools and resources that will enhance our ability to train, mentor, and support our veteran developers.

## What This Means for Vets Who Code

As part of the GitHub Global Campus Program, we have been upgraded to an **organization plan with unlimited free private repositories and unlimited seats.** This will allow our community to collaborate more effectively, work on projects securely, and build a strong foundation for their future careers in software development.

Additionally, we now have access to **GitHub Classroom,** a powerful platform designed to streamline the learning experience for our troops. GitHub Classroom will enable us to **manage assignments, review code more efficiently, and provide real-world development experience** using industry-standard tools.

## Benefits of the GitHub Global Campus Program

By joining the GitHub Global Campus Program, Vets Who Code will receive:

- **GitHub Enterprise licenses** – Providing advanced features to support our nonprofit’s mission of training veterans in software development.
- **Access to GitHub Education tools** – Including GitHub Classroom, teacher discussions, and exclusive educational resources.
- **A global network of educators and developers** – Connecting us with a community dedicated to improving technical education.
- **Increased collaboration opportunities** – Allowing our troops to engage with open-source projects and build industry connections.

## What’s Next?

In the coming weeks, our team will fully integrate these new resources into our curriculum. We will explore **GitHub Classroom, introduce best practices for version control, and provide our students with even more opportunities to engage with the developer community.** This partnership strengthens our ability to deliver high-quality, real-world training that prepares veterans for successful careers in tech.

We are grateful to **GitHub Education** for recognizing the impact of Vets Who Code and providing us with the tools to take our mission to the next level. We look forward to leveraging these resources to further empower our veterans and help them transition into rewarding careers in technology.

Stay tuned for more updates as we roll out these new capabilities!
