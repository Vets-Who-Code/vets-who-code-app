High quality education can make all the difference in people’s lives. It helps individuals escape poverty, earn a promotion, or find better paid jobs. But getting a university degree or a training certificate often costs a lot of money, and strict class schedules clash with work shifts, preventing people from enrolling in educational programs.

> Fortunately, online courses are providing a viable alternative for millions of people. And as a part of the thriving e-learning industry that will grow to $325 billion by 2025, they’re no longer a fringe idea.

Instead, online courses are becoming increasingly popular, and there are many reasons why they’re the future of education.

1. Online learning offers convenience and flexibility
2. High-quality student-tutor interactions
3. Studying online is affordable for many people
4. All age groups benefit from online learning
5. More students can be enrolled
6. There’s a vast amount of online learning resources
7. Web-based learning will grow in popularity

**Online learning offers convenience and flexibility**

Flexibility is one of the key reasons behind the growing demand for web-based learning. According to survey results published by the university ranking website Best Colleges, 59% of students who enroll in online education programs have children and 50% of them are employed. They highly value the opportunity to study when they can, as lectures are typically archived for later reference, making compulsory campus attendance a thing of the past. Also, they can work faster or slower on course material, depending on their current needs and understanding of the subject matter.

**High-quality student-tutor interactions**

Another advantage of online education is improved communication between students and tutors. A study by California State University in San Bernardinofound that although people who study online absorb knowledge equally well as those who go to class, they’re more active in discussions and enjoy a better interaction with instructors. Technologies such as video conferencing and VOIP calls make it easy to communicate with people across the world. Online students also benefit from more frequent assessments, with professors able to spot knowledge gaps faster and provide suggestions on how to move forward.
