</ul>

In 2025, most veteran coding programs still follow the same failed playbook: Pack a classroom with transitioning service members, rush through outdated curriculum, and chase VET TEC dollars while ignoring real outcomes. The result? Veterans left holding certificates but lacking the practical skills employers demand.

As Executive Director of Vets Who Code, I've seen what it takes to help people transition successfully into tech; I've trained over 300 veterans and military spouses and watched many grow into senior engineers, engineering managers, and even mentors themselves. Their success came from something most boot camps don't provide: personalized guidance from developers who remember exactly what it's like to be a few steps behind where they are now. Their practical skills are often outdated, and those promises collapse under real-world pressure without a degree or alumni network to fall back on.

That's why we've evolved our mentorship practice into a fully developed Mentorship Program, built around a simple principle: The best mentor isn't the most experienced developer‚Äîit's the one who recently overcame the exact challenges you're facing now.

Unlike traditional programs that pair junior developers with senior engineers who've forgotten what it's like to learn, we match veterans with mentors no more than two years ahead in their journey. It's a high-accountability, outcomes-oriented system designed to pair veterans and military spouses with experienced developers who are close enough in skill level to provide tactical guidance‚Äîbecause that's how people grow. We're talking weekly check-ins, pair programming, and personalized guidance that helps our mentees learn and level up.

### Mentorship That Moves the Needle

This program was born from necessity. Too many boot camps preach practical skills yet fail to teach industry practices. We focus on what matters‚Äîthings like GitHub fluency, collaborative problem-solving, and building career capital that employers respect.

Whether you're a veteran who wants to accelerate your transition into tech or a developer looking to give back, our program is built to foster mutual growth. It's not just about teaching others‚Äîit's about learning how to lead, communicate clearly, and solve problems in real-time.

Here's what you can expect:

- Structured pair programming sessions focused on growth, not perfection.
- Weekly check-ins that drive accountability and progress.
- Real mentorship‚Äîconversations beyond syntax and into systems thinking, career strategy, and business context.
- Matching is based on proximity of experience, not arbitrary titles.

### Our Track Record

- 10 Years of experience supporting veterans in tech.
- 300+ Veterans trained and mentored.
- 10+ Subjects taught, from frontend engineering to APIs and deployment.
- 90% Satisfaction Rate‚Äîand we aim higher every year.

We've done the work, refined the process, and are now scaling it because every veteran deserves a pathway into tech that doesn't rely on luck, outdated curriculum, or hollow promises.

### How to Join the Vets Who Code Mentorship Program

**Step 1: Determine Your Role**  
Are you seeking guidance as a mentee or looking to share your expertise as a mentor? If you're a veteran who would qualify as a VWC troop, you're eligible to apply as a mentee. Mentors must have no more than two years of experience above the mentee's level. This is about relatability and relevance.

**Step 2: Complete the Interest Form**  
Fill out the mentorship interest form. Whether you're applying as a mentor or mentee, this step is required. Mentees must include a GitHub profile‚Äîyour code tells a story, and we want to read it.

**Step 3: Profile Review**  
We assess mentee GitHub portfolios to gauge experience. This isn't about judgment‚Äîit's about accurate pairing.

**Step 4: Interview**  
Every applicant will undergo a short interview with our team. We're here to align expectations, understand your goals, and ensure that you're ready to invest in the process.

**Step 5: Confirm Eligibility**  
Mentees must be veterans eligible for our program and not currently in a full-time developer role. Paid apprenticeships may qualify. Mentors must be within two years of their matched mentee's experience level.

**Step 6: Self-Assess**  
You'll complete a brief skill self-assessment during the interview or form process. This helps us build effective mentor/mentee pairs.

**Step 7: Matching**  
After evaluation, we pair you with a partner based on skill proximity, goals, and learning style. Final approval happens here.

**Step 8: Begin**  
Once matched, your mentorship begins. Expect structure, community, and progress tracking‚Äîwe're here to build developers, not just match resumes.

### Why This Matters

The tech industry doesn't need another feel-good veteran initiative. It needs a proven system that turns military precision into engineering excellence. Our mentors aren't just experienced‚Äîthey're recently experienced. They remember the stumbling blocks because they just cleared them themselves. That's the difference between theoretical guidance and practical acceleration.

This program is about access, accountability, and acceleration. It's where veterans and military spouses find guides who speak their language, understand their challenges, and know exactly how to help them level up‚Äîbecause they just did it themselves.

If you're ready to make tech more inclusive, practical, and purpose-driven‚Äîjoin us.
