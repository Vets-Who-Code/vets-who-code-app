## Bridging the Gap: From Combat Boots to Code – A Journey with Vets Who Code

### Background and Motivation

Navigating my path into the tech world and the military was anything but conventional. Initially, I pursued a degree in Computer Science and then spent a decade as a Software Engineer at a startup in the sports and entertainment industry. The tech world treated me well, but an itch to serve my country led me to trade my code editor for combat boots. After three years of full-time service in the Army, I transitioned to the National Guard. Naturally, my next step was to return to tech. But, three years away from the fast-moving tech world can feel like an eternity. When I came across Vets Who Code, it was the perfect fit to get up-to-date, solidify my fundamentals, and find a community to support my efforts.

### Discovering Vets Who Code

I first heard about Vets Who Code from an episode of the Syntax.fm Podcast featuring Jerome as a guest. Jerome's passion for the program and its mission resonated with me, and I reached out to him on LinkedIn. I was eager to get involved. At the time, I had been diving into various tutorials and resources, and I was expecting to build yet another to-do list app. But after pairing up with Schuster and discussing the curriculum, I was pleasantly surprised. The program emphasized the full-cycle development process—from conceptualizing and presenting mockups to outlining user journeys and breaking projects into workable chunks of code. This approach fostered a deeper level of learning and understanding, making the experience far from the typical copy-paste exercises.

### Building Skills and Gaining Knowledge

As a strong believer in "being brilliant in the basics," I found the initial portions of the program invaluable. My recent professional experience had been focused on frameworks and tools like React, Angular, MUI, and Express. The program required me to dust off my vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, which was initially challenging but ultimately rewarding. This back-to-basics approach underscored the importance of a deep understanding of underlying technologies. As I progressed, I evolved my project using NextJS, Tailwind, and deployed it live on Vercel.

### Overcoming Challenges with Community Support

Transitioning back into tech in mid-2023 was challenging, especially with the job market in flux. I leaned heavily on the Vets Who Code community to refine my resume, highlight key experiences, and prepare for interviews. The community's support was invaluable, providing a wealth of connections and resources for job seekers at any stage of their careers.

### Career Impact

Participating in Vets Who Code significantly boosted my confidence and honed my skills. Since completing the program, I have secured a role as a Staff Software Engineer at Jump, a ticketing startup focused on live events. We've been preparing for our first client launch, aiming to disrupt the industry. Being part of the team building the product from scratch has been immensely fulfilling, and the continual learning mindset emphasized at Vets Who Code has been instrumental in tackling new challenges.

### Personal Growth and Development

The program emphasized mastering the basics, embracing continual learning, and being confident in one's abilities. These principles have been pivotal in my personal and professional growth. Veterans bring a wealth of real-world experience and intangibles to the table. Knowing how to translate these strengths into the tech world is incredibly valuable, and the Vets Who Code community has been a great conduit for this transition.

### Future Aspirations

I'm currently enjoying my role as an individual contributor and aim to deepen my expertise in back-end engineering, focusing on big data, serverless technologies, and infrastructure. However, the entrepreneurial spirit still lingers, and I'm always one good idea away from a bootstrapped side project. Vets Who Code remains a great resource for tech banter, feedback, and support, and I look forward to being an active member of the community.

### Advice for Fellow Veterans

To other veterans considering a transition to tech through Vets Who Code, my advice is simple: trust the process and stay consistent. There will be times of frustration and doubt, but the community and mentors are there to help. Building a deliberate practice of chipping away at the material every day is crucial. Even if you only have a few minutes, use them. Consistency is key to making progress and avoiding the need to refresh after a long break.

### Final Thoughts

My experience with Vets Who Code has been top-notch. The program not only refreshed and enhanced my tech skills but also honed the soft skills essential for success as a software engineer. More importantly, it has provided a supportive community with diverse expertise and a willingness to help. I'm grateful to be part of Vets Who Code and look forward to contributing to the community's success in the future.
