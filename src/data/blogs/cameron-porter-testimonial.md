### From Coast Guard Yeoman to Tech Professional: My Journey with Vets Who Code

Transitioning from military life to a civilian career can be daunting, but for many veterans, it presents an opportunity to explore new interests and build a second career. I'm Cameron, a former Coast Guard Yeoman, and here's my story of how I turned my passion for technology into a thriving career with the help of Vets Who Code (VWC).

#### Embracing Technology in the Coast Guard

I served as a Yeoman in the Coast Guard. During my time there, I saw the potential for technology to streamline our processes and improve efficiency. I enjoyed the personal tech projects I took on, and when I decided to transition out of the military, a tech career seemed like the perfect fit.

#### Discovering Vets Who Code

I was initially driven to learn as much practical information as possible. However, once I became part of VWC, I realized the immense value of a veteran-owned and operated non-profit dedicated to teaching veterans. It motivated me to learn to give back and help other transitioning veterans achieve their tech goals.

My first encounter with VWC was a mix of hope and excitement. I was still determining what to expect, but I was hopeful it would be better than my IT degree. The program exceeded my expectations in every way. The cohort style, with small groups and a dedicated instructor, was incredibly personal and engaging. It was the perfect learning environment for me.

#### Building Skills and Confidence

Throughout the VWC program, I gained invaluable skills and knowledge. We covered so much, but working with JavaScript, React, Next.js, and GitHub Actions stood out. The depth of the material far surpassed anything I learned in my bachelor's degree.

More than just technical skills, the program taught me the mindset of a developer. Key lessons included understanding the problem before jumping to solutions, prioritizing readability over complexity, and leveraging your skills for professional advantage. This mindset shift was the most valuable takeaway.

#### Overcoming Challenges with Support

Transitioning from the military to the tech industry wasn't without its challenges. I faced the daunting task of learning new programming languages, adapting to a different work culture, and understanding the complex world of software development. The mentorship and community support at VWC were crucial. They showed me what tech life was like before I landed a job. The mentors pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and try new things, which was essential for my growth.

#### Career Transformation

The impact of VWC on my career has been profound. The knowledge and skills I gained have greatly enhanced my career. In just two years, I more than doubled my salary, providing financial security for my family and allowing my wife to stay home with our kids. But more than that, I've grown as a person and as a professional, and that's something no amount of money can buy.

This significant achievement is just one of my milestones since completing the program. VWC equipped me with technical skills and connected me with a network of veterans in various tech roles. Their experiences have been invaluable in guiding my career decisions.

#### Giving Back and Future Goals

Looking ahead, my goals in the tech industry are multifaceted. While I love being an individual contributor, I'm also interested in management. But no matter where my career takes me, one thing will always be important to me: giving back. VWC's structure encourages former students to become mentors, and I'm proud to be a part of that. It's a way for me to extend a hand to those coming after me, and it's a reminder of the support I received when I was starting out.

#### Words of Wisdom for Fellow Veterans

For other veterans considering a transition to a tech career through Vets Who Code, I have clear advice: Do it. Don't wait. Take action, take it seriously, and strive to improve every day. Be prepared for the challenges, but don't let them discourage you. If you're willing to work, this path will help you achieve your goals.

Reflecting on my journey, I realize that my experience with VWC was terrific. It matched my learning style, pushed me to grow, and provided financial freedom for my family. I highly recommend VWC to any veteran looking to transition into tech.

#### Final Thoughts

My journey from Coast Guard Yeoman to tech professional is a testament to the transformative power of Vets Who Code. By providing veterans with the skills, support, and community they need, VWC is changing not just careers but lives.
