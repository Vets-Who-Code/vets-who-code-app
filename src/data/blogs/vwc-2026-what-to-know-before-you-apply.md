Applications close February 14, 2026. The cohort starts April 7th.

We rebuilt the program from scratch this year. Here's what changed, what it requires, and how to know if it's right for you.

## Why We Rebuilt the Program

I've been running Vets Who Code since 2014. We've trained 300+ veterans. Graduates have collectively earned over $20 million at companies like Microsoft, Google, and Home Depot.

The program worked.

But the market changed.

AI didn't just add a new skill to learn—it rewrote the rules. Companies aren't hiring the same way they were two years ago. The engineers getting hired now are the ones who can build AI-enabled systems, not just consume them.

So we rebuilt everything.

Here's what's different:

- **Substantial pre-work.** Phase 0 is 40-60 hours before Day 1. You complete it before applying.
- **AI engineering integrated throughout**—not bolted on as an afterthought.
- **Skills validated against real labor market data.** We used Lightcast APIs—the same intelligence Fortune 500 companies use to forecast hiring—to verify every skill we teach is in demand.
- **Smaller cohorts.** 13 people. This means more mentorship and tighter accountability.
- **Production commits to real Vets Who Code systems.** You won't build todo apps. You'll push code to a live platform serving thousands of veterans.

The structure is closer to joining an engineering team than attending a class.

## What You'll Learn

The curriculum covers 128 skills across four phases, each validated against current job postings:

**Phase 1: Foundations**
Terminal mastery. VS Code configuration. Git and GitHub workflows. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python fundamentals. We don't allow AI tools here—the goal is building fluency you can rely on under pressure. You'll work through code challenges at an intermediate level before advancing.

**Phase 2: Software Engineering**
TypeScript. Next.js 14+ with App Router. Testing with Jest and Playwright. CI/CD with GitHub Actions. Vercel deployment. You'll ship real features to real users on the Vets Who Code platform.

**Phase 3: AI Engineering**
FastAPI with Pydantic v2. Google Gemini integration—text, multimodal, function calling. Professional prompt engineering. RAG systems with pgvector. AI agents with LangChain and LangGraph. Full-stack AI applications with streaming interfaces.

**Phase 4: Production Mastery**
Testing AI systems. LLMOps with LangSmith. Docker containerization. Google Cloud Run deployment. Load testing with K6. Ethics, safety, and governance.

## What This Requires

- 17 weeks, starting April 7, 2026
- 100% remote via Zoom, Monday-Thursday evenings
- 8 hours live instruction per week
- 12-16 hours self-guided work per week
- 40-60 hours of pre-work before Day 1

That's 20-24 hours per week for 17 weeks.

The program is designed around people who have jobs, families, and responsibilities. But it does require consistent time and focus. The veterans who do well treat it as a serious commitment alongside the rest of their lives.

## Is This the Right Fit?

This program works best for people who:

- Have already decided they want to become software engineers
- Have written at least some code before (tutorials, self-study, anything)
- Can realistically commit 20-24 hours per week for 17 weeks
- Want structure and accountability, not self-paced learning

If you're still exploring whether coding is for you, that's fine—but this isn't the right starting point. The pace is fast, and the cohort moves together. The pre-work exists so everyone starts ready.

You'll need a computer no more than two years old and reliable internet. The program is free—Vets Who Code is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

## Why Vets Who Code

I built this program because I wished it existed when I was making the transition myself.

I learned to code while balancing military life, family, and the reality of starting over. That's why this program is:

- Built by veterans, for veterans
- Designed for adults with real responsibilities
- Focused on production work, not hypotheticals
- Small enough that we can actually support you

When you interview after this program, you won't show tutorials. You'll show commits to a live codebase with real users.

## How to Apply

Applications close February 14, 2026.

Start the pre-work now: [github.com/Vets-Who-Code/Prework](https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/Prework)

You'll need:

- DD-214 or proof of military service (military spouses eligible)
- Completed Phase 0 pre-work
- Commitment to attend all live sessions

If you have questions, reach out. If you're ready, start the pre-work.
