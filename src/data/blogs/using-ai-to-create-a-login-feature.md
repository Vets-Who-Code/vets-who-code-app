## Introduction

In this post, we'll explore how to use AI tools like GitHub Copilot Workspaces and OpenAI to create an efficient login feature in a Next.js application.

## Creating the Login Feature

By leveraging prompt engineering and existing code bases, the core functionality of a login feature was implemented using Next.js. This feature includes:

- **Login Form**: A simple and user-friendly interface for users to enter their credentials.
- **Welcome Message**: A personalized greeting displayed upon successful login.
- **Profile and Bio**: Sections to display user information and a brief biography.
- **User Context Handling**: Logic to manage user sessions and authentication status.

The implementation process, completed in just one hour and 28 minutes, demonstrates the power and efficiency of using AI in coding tasks.
