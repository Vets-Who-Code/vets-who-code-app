In this Q&A, GitHub's ReadME Project gathers insights from experienced educators, including Jerome Hardaway, on best practices for teaching technical skills. Hardaway emphasizes the importance of transparency in the learning process, stating that demonstrating problem-solving and embracing mistakes can help students understand that expertise comes from experience, not innate intelligence.

He advises instructors to develop templates for their teaching materials to streamline content creation and focus more on delivering valuable lessons. Other contributors highlight the significance of understanding different learning styles, encouraging project-based learning, and starting with imperfect materials to foster continuous improvement.

The discussion underscores that effective technical education involves empathy, adaptability, and a commitment to creating supportive learning environments.
