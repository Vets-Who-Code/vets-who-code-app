This article highlights the mission of Vets Who Code, a nonprofit organization founded by Air Force veteran Jerome Hardaway in 2014. Recognizing the challenges veterans face when transitioning to civilian life, particularly underemployment, Jerome took the initiative to learn programming and became a full-stack developer. He established Vets Who Code to proactively address these issues by teaching veterans how to code, thereby closing the digital skills gap and easing their career transitions.

The organization has successfully helped numerous veterans secure employment in the tech industry by providing technical training and community support.

Pluralsight plays a significant role in Vets Who Code's curriculum by providing supplementary learning resources. Jerome notes that Pluralsight adds legitimacy to their program and enhances the learning experience for veterans. The platform's comprehensive courses help veterans strengthen their skills, making them more competitive in the job market. Jerome emphasizes the value Pluralsight brings, stating that it makes veterans feel supported and invested in by the broader tech community.
