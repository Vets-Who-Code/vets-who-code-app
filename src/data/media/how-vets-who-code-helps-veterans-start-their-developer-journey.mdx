In honor of Veterans Day, HackerRank launched the "Veterans Who Code" series, sharing stories of veteran developers who have successfully transitioned into tech careers. This article focuses on Vets Who Code, a nonprofit founded by Air Force veteran Jerome Hardaway in 2014, which teaches veterans computer science courses and prepares them for the civilian workforce.

The piece features interviews with Vets Who Code alumni, including Carla Kroll, Schuster Braun, and Eddie Prislac, who share their experiences transitioning from military service to tech roles. They discuss the challenges faced during this transition, the importance of community support, and how Vets Who Code provided them with the skills and confidence needed to succeed in the tech industry.

Since its inception, Vets Who Code has helped 250 veterans land developer jobs, emphasizing the organization's impact on bridging the gap between military service and civilian tech careers.
