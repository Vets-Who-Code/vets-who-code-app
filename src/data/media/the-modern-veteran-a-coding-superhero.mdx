In this feature, GitHub's ReadME Project spotlights Jerome Hardaway, an Air Force veteran who founded Vets Who Code to help fellow veterans transition into tech careers. Recognizing the challenges veterans face when reentering the workforce, Hardaway established the nonprofit to teach coding skills remotely, a model that proved resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic.()

Vets Who Code has trained over 250 veterans across 37 states, focusing on providing the necessary tools and support for a successful career in technology. Hardaway emphasizes that veterans don't need prior tech experienceâ€”just a laptop, basic algebra skills, and the discipline they've honed during military service.()

The program's success is evident, with graduates securing jobs in the tech industry. Hardaway, often referred to as the "Captain America of Codes," continues to advocate for expanding access to tech education for veterans, aiming to scale the program without compromising quality.()
