This interview highlights how Jerome Hardaway, an Air Force veteran, transitioned into tech by teaching himself to code and eventually becoming a Developer Advocate. He discusses the origins of Vets Who Code, a nonprofit that teaches veterans JavaScript and modern web development tools such as React, Gatsby, and GraphQL, all free of charge.

Jerome reflects on his early struggles learning with an SQL book and online tutorials, emphasizing how real-world experience and building projects helped him succeed. He shares how launching Vets Who Code led to greater opportunities—including being honored at the White House by President Obama—and how that work continues to impact veterans’ lives today.

He offers practical advice for aspiring developers, especially veterans: start building something now. His story reinforces the importance of self-starting, persistence, and service-driven leadership in the tech world.
