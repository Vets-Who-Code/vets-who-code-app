      excited...then mad again. But in the end, I&apos;ve developed skills that have

      group of people in VWC that understand me, and we really work and grow
      together better than anything I could have imagined.`,

    text: `During my transition, I have signed up for and utilized services from
      over 14 different Non-Profits, Corporate, and State resources. I attended all
      three US Army military transition tracks (Business, Education, Career), been a
      part of a variety of technology training programs and transition programs. Of
      all of these programs, only three have made a significant contribution to my
      transition, and of these three organizations, only one has truly changed my
      life for the better. Vets Who Code delivered more value to me than 12 of the
      non-profits combined.`,
