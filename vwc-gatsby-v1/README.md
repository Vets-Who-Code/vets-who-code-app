# gatsby-starter-default

The default Gatsby starter

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:

```
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

## Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

# Run Locally

## `Assumes you have installed the gatsbyCLI`

1. Navigate to `vwc-gatsby-v1`
2. Install dependencies

```
~ npm install
~ yarn install
```

3. Run `gatsby develop`
4. Copy everything in `test-dev-index.html` and paste it in to `public/index.html` (this is a hacky work around until we can sort out how to properly inject these script tags into the dom)

5. Navigate to `localhost:8000`
