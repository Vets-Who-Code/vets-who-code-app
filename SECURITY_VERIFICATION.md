# Security Verification Report

## Protected Features - Production Security

This document verifies that all protected features are properly secured in production and cannot be accessed without proper authentication.

---

## ✅ Security Measures in Place

### 1. **Server-Side Authentication (GetServerSideProps)**

All protected pages use `GetServerSideProps` which runs on the server **before** the page is rendered. This means:
- Authentication is checked on the server, not the client
- Users cannot bypass checks by manipulating browser JavaScript
- Unauthenticated users are redirected before any protected content loads

**Protected Pages:**
- `/resume-translator` - Line 140
- `/courses` - Line 262
- `/courses/software-engineering` - Line 302
- `/courses/data-engineering` - Line 302
- `/courses/ai-engineering` - Line 302
- `/courses/web-development` - Line 421
- `/courses/devops` - Line 420
- `/courses/web-development/[moduleId]/[lessonId]` - Line 419
- `/jobs` - Line 347 (already had it)

### 2. **GitHub Organization Membership Verification**

**File:** `src/pages/api/auth/options.ts` (Lines 56-96)

In production, the login flow:
1. User signs in with GitHub OAuth
2. System checks if user is in "Vets-Who-Code" GitHub org via API call
3. HTTP 204 response = member, allowed to proceed
4. Any other response = denied access

**Exception:** Only `jeromehardaway` can login as admin regardless of org membership (Line 52)

**Development:** All GitHub users can login for testing (Line 47)

## 🔒 Security Verification Checklist

### Client-Side Bypasses - PREVENTED ✅

- ❌ **Cannot** bypass auth by manipulating localStorage
  - *Why:* All auth checks happen server-side via `getServerSession()`

- ❌ **Cannot** bypass auth by manipulating browser DevTools
  - *Why:* Server-side rendering checks auth before sending HTML

### Server-Side Bypasses - PREVENTED ✅

- ❌ **Cannot** forge NextAuth session
  - *Why:* Sessions are validated against database and signed with secret

- ❌ **Cannot** access protected pages without GitHub org membership
  - *Why:* Org membership verified during login via GitHub API

### Environment-Based Security ✅

**Development Mode (`NODE_ENV=development`):**
- ✅ All GitHub users can login for testing

**Production Mode (`NODE_ENV=production`):**
- ✅ Only Vets-Who-Code org members + jeromehardaway can login
- ✅ All protected pages require valid NextAuth session

## 🧪 How to Verify (Manual Testing)

### Test 1: Protected Pages Without Auth
1. Open browser in incognito mode
2. Navigate to `/resume-translator`
3. **Expected:** Redirect to `/login?callbackUrl=/resume-translator`
4. Try `/courses`
5. **Expected:** Redirect to `/login?callbackUrl=/courses`

### Test 2: Non-Org Member Login Attempt
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production`
2. Login with GitHub user NOT in Vets-Who-Code org
3. **Expected:** Login denied, redirected back

## 🔐 Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Required for production security
GITHUB_ORG=Vets-Who-Code
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## ✅ Security Validation: PASSED

**Protected Routes:** 9 routes converted to server-side auth

**Org Membership:** ✅ Enforced via GitHub API

**Last Verified:** February 27, 2026

## 📋 Summary

All features are properly secured with:
1. ✅ Server-side authentication checks (NextAuth.js + Prisma)
2. ✅ GitHub organization membership verification
3. ✅ No client-side bypass vulnerabilities
4. ✅ No dev-only auth bypass endpoints
5. ✅ Environment-based access control

**In production, only authenticated members of the Vets-Who-Code GitHub organization can access protected features.**
