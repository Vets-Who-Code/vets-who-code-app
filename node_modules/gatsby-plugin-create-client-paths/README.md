# gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths

Use this plugin to simplify creating a “hybrid” Gatsby app with both statically
rendered pages as well as "client-paths". These paths exist exist on the client
only and do not correspond to `index.html` files in an app's built assets.

## Usage

Install:

```
yarn add gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths
```

Then configure via `gatsby-config.js`:

```
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths`,
      options: { prefixes: [`/app/*`] },
    },
```

In this example, all paths prefixed by `/app/` will render the route described
in `src/pages/app/index.js`.
