# Welcome to Vets Who Code Web App :tada:

Hey there, Soldier! Welcome to the **Vets Who Code Web App**. This project serves as a communal code base where military vets and their spouses can sharpen their coding skills. üöÄ

## What's Under The Hood üß∞

This app is built using a jam-packed tech stack including:

- Tailwind
- Next.js
- Playwright
- Typescript
- MDX
- Lerna architecture

### Our Mission :dart:

1. **Empower Veterans and Military Spouses**: We're creating a production-grade app that addresses the unique needs of our community.
  
2. **Ever-Evolving Platform**: New features are continuously added to provide valuable tools for our users.
  
3. **Learn By Doing**: The project serves as a hands-on experience for our community to learn and grow their coding skills.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get a local copy up and running, you'll need a few things installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

### Installation Steps :wrench:

Fire up your terminal and run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/vets-who-code-app.git
$ cd vets-who-code-app
$ nvm install
$ yarn add
$ npm run dev
```

And boom! Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the app.

## Development using Dev Container (Optional) üê≥

We have a development container to help you quickly set up your dev environment. This is completely optional but can make getting started easier.

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote - Containers extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/vets-who-code-app.git
    cd vets-who-code-app
    ```

2. **Open in VS Code**
    - Open the root directory in VS Code.
    - A notification will appear asking if you would like to reopen the project in a dev container. Choose "Reopen in Container".
    - If you don't see the notification, open the Command Palette (`F1`) and run `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

3. **Wait for the Build**
    - The dev container will build based on the `Dockerfile` and `devcontainer.json` configuration. This may take a few minutes the first time.

4. **Start Developing**
    - After the container is built, VS Code will attach to it. You're now developing inside the container!

Remember, this is optional. If you prefer to set up your development environment manually, you can continue to do so.
