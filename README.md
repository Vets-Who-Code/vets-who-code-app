# Welcome to Vets Who Code Web App :tada:

Hey there, Soldier! Welcome to the **Vets Who Code Web App**. This project serves as a communal code base where military vets and their spouses can sharpen their coding skills. üöÄ

## What's Under The Hood üß∞

This app is built using a modern tech stack including:

-   Next.js 15
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Playwright for testing
-   MDX for content
-   shadcn/ui components
-   Server Actions
-   Server Components

### Our Mission :dart:

1. **Empower Veterans and Military Spouses**: We're creating a production-grade app that addresses the unique needs of our community.

2. **Ever-Evolving Platform**: New features are continuously added to provide valuable tools for our users.

3. **Learn By Doing**: The project serves as a hands-on experience for our community to learn and grow their coding skills.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get a local copy up and running, you'll need a few things installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

-   [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (v18.18.0 or higher)
-   [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended) or npm

### Installation Steps :wrench:

Fire up your terminal and run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/vets-who-code-app.git
$ cd vets-who-code-app
$ nvm use
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the app in action.

## Development using Dev Container (Optional) üê≥

We support development containers for an easier setup experience.

### Requirements

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [Remote - Containers extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/vets-who-code-app.git
    cd vets-who-code-app
    ```

2. **Open in VS Code**

    - Open the root directory in VS Code.
    - When prompted, choose "Reopen in Container"
    - Or use Command Palette (`F1`) and run `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

3. **Start Developing**
    - Once the container is built and running, you're ready to code!

Remember, this is optional. If you prefer to set up your development environment manually, you can continue to do so.
