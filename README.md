# Vets Who Code Web App

The Vets Who Code Web App is a multifaceted application built using Tailwind, Next.js, Playwright, Typescript, MDX, and the Lerna architecture. The purpose of this app is threefold: Firstly, to create a production-grade product that benefits all veterans and military spouses; secondly, to enable the continuous addition of new features that all veterans can utilize; and thirdly, to serve as an open-source app where our troops can learn how to write code. By actively working on this app, pulling tickets, and making changes as needed, our troops can gain practical experience, contributing to a professional, fast, and serverless product designed with their needs in mind.
